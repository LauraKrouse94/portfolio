      <p>  For the past six months I have been working closely with the Object Stories Exhibit at the Portland Art Museum. I worked primarily as an Event Coordinator. My main project was putting on a community event highlighting the work of local advocates and activists in the Portland community. This event took place at The 1905 on December 2nd 2017.</p>
    <p>  Below are the statistics of the event, highlighting who attended the event, spoke at the event and how many people this event reached online. I worked on this project soley and coordinated the event, scouting for venues, finding and interviewing speakers, running an hour long training session with the group of speakers, running the online presence, marketing the event and working closely with the bar manager of The 1905 to make sure the overall event went smoothly while I MC'd the event.  </p>
