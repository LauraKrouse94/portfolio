    <p>I have worked as a Leadership and Advocacy Volunteer with Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette for the last three years. I worked primarily on the Speakers Bureau in coordinating large scale Speak-Out events in the Portland area.
   </p>
   <p>My team of four people and I canvassed for speakers, trained speakers, found affordable venues, promoted the events and MC'd the events.</p>
   <p>I was eventually elected to become the chair of the Speakers Bureau, where I attended Officer's meeetings, planned our monthly meetings and helped deligate tasks to my team members. </p>
